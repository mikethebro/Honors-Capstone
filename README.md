# Undergraduate Thesis: Algorithmic Trading
Writing algorithms to find optimal times to buy and sell stocks and cryptocurrencies.
## Fundamental Goal
To learn algorithmic trading by creating and testing various algorithms with live market prices.

## Algorithms
### <a href="/Moving Averages/">Moving Averages</a>
Algorithms using the moving averages of the stock price over multiple days.

### <a href="/Mean Reversion/">Mean Reversion</a>
Improvement on Moving Averages where algorithms will place limits above and below the moving average.  
This will allow buy and sell times to more closely approach the highs and lows.

### Dynamic Mean Reversion
Improvement on Mean Reversion algorithm. Algorithm will dynamically change limits in accordance with stock's volatility.

## Results: Cryptocurrencies

## Results: Stock Market
